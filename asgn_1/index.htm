          David Robert Jones OAL (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known
          professionally as David Bowie (/ˈboʊi/ BOH-ee),was an English
          singer-songwriter and actor. A leading figure in the music industry,
          Bowie is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th
          century. He was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for
          his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by
          reinvention and visual presentation, with his music and stagecraft
          having a significant impact on popular music. During his lifetime, his
          record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made
          him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. In the UK, he
          was awarded ten platinum album certifications, eleven gold and eight
          silver, and released eleven number-one albums. In the US, he received
          five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the
          Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Rolling Stone placed him among its
          list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and named him the
          "Greatest Rock Star Ever" following his death in 2016.
